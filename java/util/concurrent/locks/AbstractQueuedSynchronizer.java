/**
 * Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related
 * synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on
 * first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues.  This class is designed to
 * be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a
 * single atomic {@code int} value to represent state. Subclasses
 * must define the protected methods that change this state, and which
 * define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired
 * or released.  Given these, the other methods in this class carry
 * out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain
 * other state fields, but only the atomically updated {@code int}
 * value manipulated using methods {@link #getState}, {@link
 * #setState} and {@link #compareAndSetState} is tracked with respect
 * to synchronization.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper
 * classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties
 * of their enclosing class.  Class
 * {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} does not implement any
 * synchronization interface.  Instead it defines methods such as
 * {@link #acquireInterruptibly} that can be invoked as
 * appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to
 * implement their public methods.
 *
 * <p>This class supports either or both a default <em>exclusive</em>
 * mode and a <em>shared</em> mode. When acquired in exclusive mode,
 * attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode
 * acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class
 * does not &quot;understand&quot; these differences except in the
 * mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next
 * waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can
 * acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the
 * same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only
 * one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a
 * {@link ReadWriteLock}. Subclasses that support only exclusive or
 * only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.
 *
 * <p>This class defines a nested {@link ConditionObject} class that
 * can be used as a {@link Condition} implementation by subclasses
 * supporting exclusive mode for which method {@link
 * #isHeldExclusively} reports whether synchronization is exclusively
 * held with respect to the current thread, method {@link #release}
 * invoked with the current {@link #getState} value fully releases
 * this object, and {@link #acquire}, given this saved state value,
 * eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state.  No
 * {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} method otherwise creates such a
 * condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it.  The
 * behavior of {@link ConditionObject} depends of course on the
 * semantics of its synchronizer implementation.
 *
 * <p>This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring
 * methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for
 * condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes
 * using an {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} for their
 * synchronization mechanics.
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic
 * integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty
 * thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will
 * define a {@code readObject} method that restores this to a known
 * initial state upon deserialization.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the
 * following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying
 * the synchronization state using {@link #getState}, {@link
 * #setState} and/or {@link #compareAndSetState}:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #tryAcquire}
 * <li> {@link #tryRelease}
 * <li> {@link #tryAcquireShared}
 * <li> {@link #tryReleaseShared}
 * <li> {@link #isHeldExclusively}
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each of these methods by default throws {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException}.  Implementations of these methods
 * must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and
 * not block. Defining these methods is the <em>only</em> supported
 * means of using this class. All other methods are declared
 * {@code final} because they cannot be independently varied.
 *
 * <p>You may also find the inherited methods from {@link
 * AbstractOwnableSynchronizer} useful to keep track of the thread
 * owning an exclusive synchronizer.  You are encouraged to use them
 * -- this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in
 * determining which threads hold locks.
 *
 * <p>Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it
 * does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies.  The core
 * of exclusive synchronization takes the form:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Acquire:
 *     while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
 *        <em>enqueue thread if it is not already queued</em>;
 *        <em>possibly block current thread</em>;
 *     }
 *
 * Release:
 *     if (tryRelease(arg))
 *        <em>unblock the first queued thread</em>;
 * </pre>
 *
 * (Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)
 *
 * <p id="barging">Because checks in acquire are invoked before
 * enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may <em>barge</em> ahead of
 * others that are blocked and queued.  However, you can, if desired,
 * define {@code tryAcquire} and/or {@code tryAcquireShared} to
 * disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection
 * methods, thereby providing a <em>fair</em> FIFO acquisition order.
 * In particular, most fair synchronizers can define {@code tryAcquire}
 * to return {@code false} if {@link #hasQueuedPredecessors} (a method
 * specifically designed to be used by fair synchronizers) returns
 * {@code true}.  Other variations are possible.
 *
 * <p>Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the
 * default barging (also known as <em>greedy</em>,
 * <em>renouncement</em>, and <em>convoy-avoidance</em>) strategy.
 * While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier
 * queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued
 * threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed
 * against incoming threads.  Also, while acquires do not
 * &quot;spin&quot; in the usual sense, they may perform multiple
 * invocations of {@code tryAcquire} interspersed with other
 * computations before blocking.  This gives most of the benefits of
 * spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without
 * most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can
 * augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with
 * "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended}
 * and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer
 * is likely not to be contended.
 *
 * <p>This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for
 * synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to
 * synchronizers that can rely on {@code int} state, acquire, and
 * release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does
 * not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic atomic} classes, your own custom
 * {@link java.util.Queue} classes, and {@link LockSupport} blocking
 * support.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 *
 * <p>Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses
 * the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to
 * represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock
 * does not strictly require recording of the current owner
 * thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor.
 * It also supports conditions and exposes
 * one of the instrumentation methods:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {
 *
 *   // Our internal helper class
 *   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
 *     // Reports whether in locked state
 *     protected boolean isHeldExclusively() {
 *       return getState() == 1;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Acquires the lock if state is zero
 *     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
 *       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
 *       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
 *         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
 *         return true;
 *       }
 *       return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Releases the lock by setting state to zero
 *     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
 *       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
 *       if (getState() == 0) throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
 *       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
 *       setState(0);
 *       return true;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Provides a Condition
 *     Condition newCondition() { return new ConditionObject(); }
 *
 *     // Deserializes properly
 *     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
 *         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
 *       s.defaultReadObject();
 *       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   // The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it.
 *   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
 *
 *   public void lock()                { sync.acquire(1); }
 *   public boolean tryLock()          { return sync.tryAcquire(1); }
 *   public void unlock()              { sync.release(1); }
 *   public Condition newCondition()   { return sync.newCondition(); }
 *   public boolean isLocked()         { return sync.isHeldExclusively(); }
 *   public boolean hasQueuedThreads() { return sync.hasQueuedThreads(); }
 *   public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
 *     sync.acquireInterruptibly(1);
 *   }
 *   public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     return sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout));
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Here is a latch class that is like a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch CountDownLatch}
 * except that it only requires a single {@code signal} to
 * fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the {@code shared}
 * acquire and release methods.
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class BooleanLatch {
 *
 *   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
 *     boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; }
 *
 *     protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) {
 *       return isSignalled() ? 1 : -1;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) {
 *       setState(1);
 *       return true;
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
 *   public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); }
 *   public void signal()         { sync.releaseShared(1); }
 *   public void await() throws InterruptedException {
 *     sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
 *   }

     * Wait queue node class.
     *
     * <p>The wait queue is a variant of a "CLH" (Craig, Landin, and
     * Hagersten) lock queue. CLH locks are normally used for
     * spinlocks.  We instead use them for blocking synchronizers, but
     * use the same basic tactic of holding some of the control
     * information about a thread in the predecessor of its node.  A
     * "status" field in each node keeps track of whether a thread
     * should block.  A node is signalled when its predecessor
     * releases.  Each node of the queue otherwise serves as a
     * specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
     * thread. The status field does NOT control whether threads are
     * granted locks etc though.  A thread may try to acquire if it is
     * first in the queue. But being first does not guarantee success;
     * it only gives the right to contend.  So the currently released
     * contender thread may need to rewait.
     *
     * <p>To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
     * tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
     * <pre>
     *      +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
     * head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
     *      +------+       +-----+       +-----+
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Insertion into a CLH queue requires only a single atomic
     * operation on "tail", so there is a simple atomic point of
     * demarcation from unqueued to queued. Similarly, dequeuing
     * involves only updating the "head". However, it takes a bit
     * more work for nodes to determine who their successors are,
     * in part to deal with possible cancellation due to timeouts
     * and interrupts.
     *
     * <p>The "prev" links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
     * needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
     * successor is (normally) relinked to a non-cancelled
     * predecessor. For explanation of similar mechanics in the case
     * of spin locks, see the papers by Scott and Scherer at
     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/
     *
     * <p>We also use "next" links to implement blocking mechanics.
     * The thread id for each node is kept in its own node, so a
     * predecessor signals the next node to wake up by traversing
     * next link to determine which thread it is.  Determination of
     * successor must avoid races with newly queued nodes to set
     * the "next" fields of their predecessors.  This is solved
     * when necessary by checking backwards from the atomically
     * updated "tail" when a node's successor appears to be null.
     * (Or, said differently, the next-links are an optimization
     * so that we don't usually need a backward scan.)
     *
     * <p>Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
     * algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
     * nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is
     * ahead or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
     * successors upon cancellation, allowing them to stabilize on
     * a new predecessor, unless we can identify an uncancelled
     * predecessor who will carry this responsibility.
     *
     * <p>CLH queues need a dummy header node to get started. But
     * we don't create them on construction, because it would be wasted
     * effort if there is never contention. Instead, the node
     * is constructed and head and tail pointers are set upon first
     * contention.
     *
     * <p>Threads waiting on Conditions use the same nodes, but
     * use an additional link. Conditions only need to link nodes
     * in simple (non-concurrent) linked queues because they are
     * only accessed when exclusively held.  Upon await, a node is
     * inserted into a condition queue.  Upon signal, the node is
     * transferred to the main queue.  A special value of status
     * field is used to mark which queue a node is on.
     *
     * <p>Thanks go to Dave Dice, Mark Moir, Victor Luchangco, Bill
     * Scherer and Michael Scott, along with members of JSR-166
     * expert group, for helpful ideas, discussions, and critiques
     * on the design of this class.
